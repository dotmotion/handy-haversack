## D&amp;D Character Sheet web app

This is meant to be a simple javascript web app to create and manage your D&D characters.

This app should cover at least the basics on the 5e player's handbook and should stay open source.

### Main objectives:

1. Create a new character

   The character sheet should help self-populate most fields by entering a race, class and the ability scores

   For this we'll be using the [5e-database](https://github.com/adrpadua/5e-database) with a few modifications

2. Load an existin character and play with it

   When loading a charachter in JSON format, it will populate the sheet and will have links to spells, items and equipment (with descriptions when available)

   There should be an edit button to level your character up

   The following fields should be editable

   - HP (& temporary HP)
   - XP (if the character is playing this way)
   - Coins
   - Equipment
